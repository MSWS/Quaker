# Quaker
## A simple Quaver cheat script

_Use at your own risk_

Quaker is a simple python script that currently cheats the videogame "Quaver".
It is currently limited to only the 4-Key layout, with performance depending on the map and scroll speed. (General recommendation is 20)
Aside from that, its usability is decent.

## Planned Features
- [X] 7k Support
